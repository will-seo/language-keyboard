      "question": "How to use this Maori keyboard?",
      "answer": "This keyboard has been designed to mimic Microsoft's Maori IME. To type a long vowel with a macron, you can either add an acute accent before the vowel (for example ` + o will come out as ō) or type the vowel followed by = (for example o + = will also become ō). The keyboard works on both desktop and mobile, and I am always looking to improve the keyboards on this site, so please <a href=\"mailto:will@languagekeyboard.net\">let me know</a> if you have any suggestions.",

    {
      "question": "What are macrons and why are they important in Maori?",
      "answer": "Macrons are horizontal lines above vowels that indicate the vowel should be held longer. In Māori, they are important because they can change the meaning of a word. For example, 'keke' means cake, while 'kēkē' can mean armpit or a duck's quack, depending on context!",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I type Maori using my regular keyboard?",
      "answer": "Yes! You can type with your normal keyboard. The online tool will automatically convert your inputs into the correct Maori letters with macrons, either using the ` + vowel method or the vowel + = method.",
      "schema": true
    },
    {
      "question": "Does this keyboard work on mobile?",
      "answer": "Yes, the keyboard works on both desktop and mobile devices. On mobile, you can tap the letters on the on-screen keyboard, and use the same methods for typing macrons. This makes typing Maori text much easier than relying on your device’s built-in keyboard.",
      "schema": true
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I copy and share what I’ve typed?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Once you’ve typed your text in Maori with the correct macrons, you can copy and paste it anywhere — emails, documents, social media, or messages. It’s a fast and reliable way to write accurately in Maori without installing extra software.",
